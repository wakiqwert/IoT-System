# IoT System
# Marine Fish Farm

The main purpose of our solution is to assist Smith Marineâ€™s fishing farm in monitoring their seafood livestock remotely and alert the respective staff when any environmental threats or issues are being encountered. 
This can be conducted through the installation of an IoT water monitoring system which comprises of 3 sensors to observe the water conditions and report back to Smith Marine with the appropriate insights regarding these 3 components: 
1. Temperature 
2. Electrical Conductivity 
3. pH Level


Implementation of Machine Learning
We can use machine learning model to process the data pass by the sensors in real time such that if the model predicts that the fish will die, it will check if EC, Temperature or PH value is above or below a recommended amount. It will then take the necessary precautions and notify the administrator.
